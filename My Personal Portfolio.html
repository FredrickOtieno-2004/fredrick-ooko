      <h3>Ugali Fish</h3>
      <p>
        Ingredients:
For the Ugali:
2 cups maize flour (cornmeal)

4 cups water

A pinch of salt

For the Fish:
4-6 pieces of your preferred fish (tilapia, tilapia fillets, or any other fish you like)

2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or cooking oil of your choice)

1 onion, chopped

2 tomatoes, chopped

2-3 cloves garlic, minced

1 tablespoon ginger, grated

1 green bell pepper, chopped (optional)

1-2 tablespoons tomato paste (optional for richer flavor)

1 teaspoon ground coriander

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1 teaspoon paprika

Salt and pepper to taste

Fresh coriander or parsley for garnish

A squeeze of lemon or lime (optional)

Instructions:
For the Ugali:
Boil water: In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to the water for flavor.

Add maize flour: Slowly pour in the maize flour while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to avoid lumps.

Cook: Continue stirring as the mixture thickens. After a few minutes, the ugali will start pulling away from the sides of the pot. Continue stirring for about 5-7 minutes until it is firm and smooth.

Serve: Once it's cooked, remove from the heat and let it sit for a minute or two. Shape it into a round or oval shape using a spoon or your hands.

For the Fish:
Prepare the fish: Clean the fish, removing the scales and guts. If using whole fish, you can fry them whole or cut them into pieces.

Cook the fish: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat. Season the fish with salt, pepper, and any other preferred spices.

Fry the fish: Cook the fish in the hot oil until golden and crispy on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside. (Alternatively, you can bake the fish for a lighter version.)

Prepare the sauce: In the same pan, add more oil if necessary, and saut√© the onions, garlic, and ginger until softened.

Add tomatoes: Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for about 5 minutes until they soften and break down into a sauce.

Add spices: Stir in the tomato paste (if using), paprika, ground coriander, cumin, and any additional spices you like. Cook for 2-3 more minutes.

Add fish back to the sauce: Add the fried fish back to the pan and gently toss to coat in the tomato sauce. Let it simmer for 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

Optional garnish: Sprinkle with chopped fresh coriander or parsley for an extra fresh flavor and squeeze some lemon or lime juice on top.

Serving:
Serve the fish and sauce over the ugali for a hearty meal. Ugali can be used to scoop up the fish and sauce. Enjoy with your favorite vegetables or a side salad!
